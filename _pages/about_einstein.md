Hi, I'm Ramya! I am currently a research scientist at ASAPP, working on AI/NLP for automating and augmenting customer service. Previously, I completed my Ph.D. and M.S. at MIT, where I worked with Prof. Julie Shah in the Interactive Robotics Group. I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech.

My research focuses on understanding conversational data and building models that can then assist and augment humans through natural language. I love to work on research problems that are grounded in impactful real-world products.
