Hi, I'm Ramya! I am currently a Staff Research Scientist at [Snorkel AI](https://snorkel.ai/). My research focuses on understanding conversational data and developing models that can assist and augment humans through natural language. I'm excited about [controlling large language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07352) and [aligning them towards user constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08300).

I'm interested in building a world where AI and people can seamlessly work together. I love to work on research problems that are grounded in impactful real-world products.

Previously, I completed my Ph.D. and M.S. at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/), where I worked with Prof. Julie Shah in the [Interactive Robotics Group](https://interactive.mit.edu/). I spent a few summers interning at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/adaptive-systems-and-interaction/overview/) and at Google. I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech.
